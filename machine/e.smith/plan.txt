57th expedition outside the walls
=================================

The Long-Distance Enemy Scouting Formation. In this formation, the Survey
Corps soldiers on horseback would be spread across a great distance in a
semicircular form divided into multiple columns. New recruits would be 
trusted with communications and spare horse maintenance. With this
strategy, Scouts at the front of the formation would warn the formation of
approaching Titans with red or black signal flares, depending on whether
it is a common Titan or an Abnormal, respectively. Upon seeing the flare,
the command group at the front of the formation would fire a green flare
in the new direction in order to avoid contact with the Titan sighted.
