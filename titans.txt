# Humans are nearly exterminated by giant creatures called Titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem
# to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a
# food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a land protected by extremely high
# walls, even taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the present, and mankind has not seen a titan in
# over 100 years. One day, 10 year old Eren and his childhood friend Mikasa witness something horrific as the city
# walls of /shiganshina are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood
# the city, the two kids watch in horror as Eren's mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single
# titan and take revenge for all of mankind.
